## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a **Computer Science student** with a deep passion for **high-performance computing**, **P2P systems**, and **distributed architectures**.  
My focus? Pushing the limits of what's possible with **optimized code** — making things run **absurdly fast** and **efficient**.

🛠️ **Languages & Tools**: I work mostly with **Mojo**, **Python**, and **C++**, with a heavy emphasis on **low-level optimizations**, **cryptography**, and **modular system architectures**.  
💡 I’m all about **compiler design**, **distributed systems**, and **3D visualization** in my projects.

🎵 Music fuels my creativity. I experiment with **procedural audio**, **sound synthesis**, and genre-blending **ambient**/ **techno** soundscapes, allowing me to merge both artistic and technical endeavors seamlessly.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On  
- **Noctix (formerly Project Genesis)** – A **distributed, consciousness-oriented computational ecosystem**, integrating **virtualized CPU resources**, **P2P networking**, and a **distributed filesystem**. Noctix leverages **advanced consensus algorithms** to create an environment where computational tasks and storage can scale infinitely and operate in a decentralized manner.
- **Insarion** – The next-generation **intelligent agent framework** that powers Noctix. It's designed with **recursive memory**, **self-modification**, and a focus on evolving and managing autonomous systems in real-time.
- **Lunaris Core** – The backbone of Noctix, providing a high-performance, modular infrastructure that integrates **dynamic memory management**, **signal processing**, and **virtualization** for distributed computing. It is also the foundation for **agent-based interactions** in the Noctix ecosystem.
- **SIMD-Optimized Cryptography** – Enhancing **cryptographic algorithms** to achieve maximum performance by utilizing **SIMD** and low-level optimization techniques. This project pushes the boundaries of cryptographic security and throughput.
- **3D Shell Visualization** – Integrating **Mojo**, **Vulkan**, and **compiler-based 3D environments** to create a **high-performance 3D shell** that enables real-time simulation and visualization of distributed systems and computational tasks.

## ⚡ Fun Fact  
🔍 I build systems that think, evolve, and transcend traditional computing. Code is just the language, but the real fun comes from creating architectures that push the boundaries of what’s possible.
